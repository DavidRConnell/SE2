%input format for "actual_counts" is labels as rows and nodes as columns,
%and values as the number of a given label received by a given node
%
%returns the number of labels each node should expect to hear at random for
%each node in an ADJ, given the current set of labels

function expected=expected_label_counts(actual_counts,kin,do_full_version)

counts_normkout=sum(actual_counts,2);  %',2)' needed for case of size-1 clusters %counts_normkout is the total number of transmitted labels (for each label); sum(actual_counts) will be sum(ADJ); thus we're counting labels, which are influenced by k -  hence the name
counts_normkout_norm1=full(counts_normkout./sum(counts_normkout));  %proportions of various labels normalized to 1
%counts_normkout_norm1 incorporates not just proportions of labels, but also k, because we care about how frequently a label is transmitted (and hence received or expected to be received)

%default
if do_full_version==0  %if matrix is very sparse, or too large to store a full ADJ, we only care about generating expected counts of labels if a node actually receives some of that label

    [x y]=find(actual_counts);   %x refers to a lable and y refers to a node




    % of note for future debugging:
    %     x  %x for some reason turns into a row when it's all 1's, which then turns [full(counts_normkout_norm1(x(:)))] into a row, when it's usually a column which then screws up the dot product

    % [kin(y)']
