%Goal is to estimate the reliability of each nodes placement in a given
%cluster by using the replicate partitions.
%
%Inputs: expects partitions to be input as rows
%"winning partition is an actual partition, NOT just a ref to where it is in "partitions"
%"winning partition" has two columns (nodeID and label)
%
%Output: a column of cells, one for each cluster, range [0 1] ,with 1 being max stability/confidence
function node_confidence_cell=node_confidence(partitions, winning_parition)

node_confidence=zeros(size(winning_parition)); %will hold same values as "node_confidence_cell'
for i=2:size(partitions,1)%ensure labels in each partition do not repeat

    partitions(i,:)=partitions(i,:)+max(partitions(i-1,:));
