%Expected to be called by function bootstrap_SpeakEasy many times, in
%order to generate replicate partitions
%
%This is the fundamental SpeakEasy2 routine that counts up actual labels, compares to
%predicted, and then selects most unexpected label for node identifier.  It has 4 variations on this.
%1) there is the basic mode where popular labels propagate,
%2) At some times it can split up ('bubble') labels into different sets,
%3) it can nurture these bubbles to try to form stable cluster and finally
%4) it can also merge two distinct labels into a single label if they have extensive connections
%
% you might be annoyed that the code looks more complicated than it needs
% to - the need for that comes from the fact we only want to update various subsets
% of nodes, which makes the indexing for counting up labels and assigning them to nodes a pain
